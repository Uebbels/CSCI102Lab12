# CSCI102Lab12
To devolop this code, I created one function at a time. After I created each function, I implemeted a printing of the return of the function with sample data that I created. If the return was not what I expected I tested the code until it was. Once the function returned what was expected, I tested edge cases or any other data that could produce error. Finally I tested the fucntion with the data given in the lab description. If that code worked, i removed the print statement and commited the code, and moved on to the next function.
